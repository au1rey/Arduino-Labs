# Arduino-Labs
Embedded Experiments with Arduino UNO/MEGA

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of embedded systems experiments using Arduino C++/INO. Each lab focuses on combining hardware and software principles to develop a deeper understanding of microcontroller programming, electronic components, and real-world interfacing.

## Projects
* Seven-Segment Display – Displayed numeric values using digital pins and timing control.

* LED Control – Practiced digital output and logic operations with multiple LEDs.

* Bluetooth Communication to OLED (Adafruit Screen) – Sent and displayed data wirelessly using Bluetooth modules and the Adafruit GFX library.

* Arduino Car (In Progress) – Integrating sensors, motor control, and wireless input to create a programmable vehicle.

## Focus Areas

* Embedded programming with C++/INO

* Hardware–software integration

* Serial communication & peripheral interfacing

* Engineering problem-solving through prototyping
